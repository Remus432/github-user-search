## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Today's challenge was building the Github User Search web app. It's my first Vue project and one of the most interesting coding experiences so far.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5**
* **CSS3**
* **Vue** (Composition API)
* **GSAP**

## Development

I've always been curious about the other JS frameworks, especially Vue because of its seemingly easy learning curve and lightweight bundle that can be further expended thanks to the modules pertaining to the Vue ecosystem.

Because there are certain aspects similar to React, I was able to gain a quicker understanding of the Vue workflow. Certainly, there have been areas where I encountered issues that took me even hours to solve.

This project is actually the first time I've ever implemented a light / dark theme toggle feature. 

I  realized near the end of the project that there definitely could be a better approach to organizing the code when it came to the light / dark theme feature. 

There have been some issues with the implementation of GSAP due to the fact that I didn't know how to link GSAP to the DOM element I wanted to target - you have to either use `this.$refs` or `ref()` if you're using the Composition API.

There are definitely **pros** and **cons** for Vue, just like there are for any framework out there. 

As someone who has only worked with React so far, I'll state that Vue can be an easier and more familiar introduction into the world of JS frameworks. There are plenty of resources out there and a big community to help you out.

Wish you an awesome time working on this project - it's definitely fun!

### Notes

* Plan ahead the structure of the app
* Focus on implementing the main features as efficiently as possible
* Write maintanble and reusable code
* Separate files in a more manageable manner
* Think of when to use Composition API over Vuex
